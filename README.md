Ryan O'Connor - Personal Website
================================
This is my personal website used to provide information about myself. I've used Foundation to help with the styling, most notably the responsive design. This website is built using Ruby on Rails the versions of which you can see below. It's currently being hosted on Heroku at https://agile-bayou-3481.herokuapp.com/ for the time being until I'm finished. Keep in mind that the website might take a little while to load due to the fact that Heroku only keeps the files in system memory until 30mins after the last request. Sorry I'm just a student right now and can't afford to pay for extra web dynos.
